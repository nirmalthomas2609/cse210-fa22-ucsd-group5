## Context and Problem Statement

Our application was intended to have Twitter integration. Given the current climate surrounding Twitter the stability of these APIs is under question. The decision for us to make is if we choose to continue with the integration.

## Decision Drivers

* Application Stability
* Time Constraints

## Decision Outcome

We chose not to integrate Twitter to our application. The instability surrounding these APIs mean they can go down at any point which would break the application leading to poor user experience.
