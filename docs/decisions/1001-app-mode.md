## Context and Problem Statement

The decision is on how to present the frontend to the user

## Decision Drivers

* User Experience
* Team Familiarity
* Cross Platform Compatibility 

## Considered Options

* Desktop Application
* Browser Application

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Browser Application", because our team has more experience with this, HTML + JS easier in browser. It is also easier for a user to interact with an application like this in a browser without worrying about an additional open window.
