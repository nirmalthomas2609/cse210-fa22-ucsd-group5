## Context and Problem Statement

We need to pick a internal team messaging tool.

## Decision Drivers

* Familiarity
* Ease of use
* Support media sharing and easy bot integration

## Considered Options

* Slack
* Discord

## Decision Outcome

We chose Discord as it had higher familiarity with team members, allowed for easy bot integrations and was not as cumbersome to manage as a slack server with multiple channels. Slack channels also tend to break into non-notifying threads which we did not want.
