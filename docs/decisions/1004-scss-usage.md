## Context and Problem Statement

We received feedback that our UI was not very appealing, so we need to improve our styling. We decided to use SCSS instead of simple CSS. 

## Decision Drivers

* Feedback from demos
* Supports nested-styling, which is key for our app that includes tweets within topics

## Decision Outcome

We updated the styling of our app using SCSS. Our next version of the UI will include SCSS.
