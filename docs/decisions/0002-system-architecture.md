## Context and Problem Statement

Design a system architecture for the functionality of supporting the note taking application. This should include detailed map of methods to be written in the backend and the interaction elements to be used by the frontend. 

## Decision Drivers

* Cohesion: The architecture needs to put similar code together to allow for easy understanding and usage 
* Modularity: Modular structure to allow for easy updates for addition or modification of functionality
* Completeness: Should be able to completely support the initial set of functionality we have planned

## Decision Outcome
