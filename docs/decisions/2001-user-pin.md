## Context and Problem Statement

The application as a note taking app might need a login flow. This decision is to consider if we want a single user login via a PIN.

## Decision Drivers

* User Friendly
* Technically Simple

## Decision Outcome

We chose not to have a user PIN. This is to keep the experience similar to other notetaking applications where you open and start taking notes without any login processes.
