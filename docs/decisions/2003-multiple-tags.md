## Context and Problem Statement

Since the original intent was to develop a twitter integrated application it might have made sense to include multiple topic tags in a note.

## Decision Drivers

* User Experience
* Simplicity of Use
* Derisking the Application

## Decision Outcome

We chose to not support multiple tags. This was because of the following reasons - 
* We did not want to commit all elements of design based on Twitter as that component might be switched out later
* The vision of the application is to allow for organizing notes by topic for easy sharing which is better supported by a folder structure
