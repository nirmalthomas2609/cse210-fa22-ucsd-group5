## Context and Problem Statement

A functionality we want to build for our app is to be able to share notes in the form of tweets. The architecture to be able to do this needs to be decided.

## Decision Drivers

* Modular
* Cohesive
* Easy to integrate into rest of the application to allow for changes or modifications later

## Decision Outcome
