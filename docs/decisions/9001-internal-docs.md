## Context and Problem Statement

We need to pick a tool for maintaining internal documentation of the team

## Decision Drivers

* Easy to use
* Support different formats
* Herarchical Organization

## Considered Options

* Google Docs
* Github Wiki
* Coda

## Decision Outcome

We chose Coda as it supported markdown, tables, media etc. and allowed for easy heirarchical management while providing a low friction UI. Github Wiki is not easy to use as everything needs to be done in markdown and google docs lacks support for a lot of different forms of information handling.
