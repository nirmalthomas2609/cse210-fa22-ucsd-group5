## Context and Problem Statement

The application is expected to be run for personal use. Given this context do we choose to support multiple user profiles.

## Decision Drivers

* User Experience
* Simplicity of Operation

## Considered Options

* Yes
* No

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "No", because it keeps the application simple. A user just opens it up and takes notes rather than having to login at every usage. This is similar as an interface to existing note taking applications that treat your machine login as unique identification.
