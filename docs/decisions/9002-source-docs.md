## Context and Problem Statement

We need to pick the source code documentation tool to be used.

## Decision Drivers

* Easy usage
* Support formatting

## Decision Outcome

We chose to use NaturalDocs as the usage was fairly simple, supported javascript natively and allowed formatted text in comments to be rendered.
